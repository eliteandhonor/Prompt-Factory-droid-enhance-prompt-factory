# Minimal Prompt App Remediation Phase 3: Automated & Manual QA Report

## Automated Test Expansion

- **API Endpoints (CRUD + Error Cases):**
  - Added [`api-crud.spec.js`](api-crud.spec.js) to cover all main endpoints (categories, tags, prompts, results, comments) for create, read, update, delete, and error scenarios.
- **UI Workflows:**
  - Added [`tag-category-crud.spec.js`](tag-category-crud.spec.js) for tag/category add, edit, delete, error/retry, and modal accessibility.
  - Existing and new tests now cover prompt, comment, and result CRUD, modal open/close, error/retry flows, and edge cases (long input, network/server errors, deleted references).
- **Accessibility & Responsive:**
  - Added [`accessibility-responsive.spec.js`](accessibility-responsive.spec.js) for ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, and mobile/responsive layout checks.
  - Existing tests cover modal Escape, focus management, and some ARIA roles.

## Manual QA: Accessibility & Mobile/Responsive

### Accessibility
- **Keyboard Navigation:** Modals open/close with keyboard (Escape, Tab, Enter). Navigation and form controls are accessible via keyboard.
- **ARIA Roles:** Modals have appropriate `role="dialog"` or `role="alertdialog"`. Some input fields have `aria-label` attributes.
- **Screen Reader:** Basic cues present, but not all interactive elements (e.g., tag/category pills, some buttons) have explicit ARIA labels or roles.
- **Issues:**
  - Some UI elements (e.g., tag/category pills, certain buttons) may lack ARIA labels or roles for full screen reader support.
  - Toast notifications use `[role="status"]`, but may need more descriptive text for screen readers.

### Mobile/Responsive
- **Viewport:** Main navigation, prompt list, and modals are visible and usable on iPhone, Pixel, and iPad viewports.
- **Layout:** Modals do not overflow viewport; layout adapts to mobile screens.
- **Issues:**
  - No major layout issues observed on tested devices.
  - Some touch targets (e.g., small buttons) could be larger for accessibility.

### Functional Issues Observed
- **Prompts Not Loading:** Prompts fail to load due to a JSON parse error (`Unexpected token 'r', "require_on"... is not valid JSON`). This blocks some UI workflows and should be fixed for full test coverage.
- **404 Error:** `/api/log.php` returns 404 (not found). Not critical for main workflows, but should be addressed.
- **General:** All other tested workflows (categories, tags, comments, results) function as expected in both desktop and mobile/responsive modes.

## Recommendations

- Fix the prompts JSON parse error to enable full CRUD UI testing.
- Add/verify ARIA labels and roles for all interactive elements (especially tag/category pills and action buttons).
- Consider increasing touch target size for small buttons on mobile.
- Address missing `/api/log.php` endpoint if required for logging.
